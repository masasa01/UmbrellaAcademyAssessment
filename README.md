 This python script demonstrates the use of genderize.io
 
 As defined in the project's README genderize.py requires two parameters: two existing files. The outfile is overwritten with data from a genderize.io request.

 I have added the parameter -OVR / --override.

 I have also implemented a search feature which allows the user to search for the specific gender information of a single name in the output file. It also allows the user to genderize that individual name if it is not in the output file.

 To demonstrate how the script works, the files in the test folder are used. All files containing "output" show the different outputs from using different parameters.
